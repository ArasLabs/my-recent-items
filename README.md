# My Recently Visited Items

Current version [v4.1](https://github.com/ArasLabs/my-recent-items/releases/tag/v4.1) supports Aras Innovator 11 SP9+.

This Add-On Package adds a stack to track the N recently visited items per user login. Item Types to be tracked can be configured to be any ItemType. (default = Document, Part, CAD,Project,Manufacturer Part,Manufacturer,Express ECO, PR,).

On the TOC, under "My Innovator", a new line "My Recently Visited" will show.

Improved configurability and multi language support

This is actually a remake of an older Add-on solution with better performance and more compact.
